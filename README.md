# M3401QC_patches
Patches for normal functioning of GNU/Linux Operating System in Asus Vivobook pro 14 OLED Ryzen 5800H/RTX3050 16GB (M3401QC)

- [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd) config at `/etc/keyd/default.conf` = [keyd.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spignelon/M3401QC_patches/main/keyd.conf)    (**keyboard patches**)
  - fixes `mute, volumedown, volumeup, brightnessdown, brightnessup` keys, from f1 to f5
  - f9 is mapped to micmute _(doesn't seem to work)_
  - f6 and f8 are remapped to `copy` and `paste` for the sake of convenience
